#meng-spad-quenching

This repository contains circuit designs for my M.Eng. project in Professor Rajeev Ram's group at MIT. These circuits are primarily related to quenching single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) fabricated in 90nm CMOS through MOSIS. My thesis contains full documentation (dspace link posted when available).
